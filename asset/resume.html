      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          My open source work ranges from advanced technical concepts such as
          parsers and syntax trees, to people-focussed community management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am experienced in JavaScript, Node.js, and frontend development.
          This includes topics such as tooling, web frameworks, performance,
          and accessibility.
          I know a lot about the inner workings of HTML, JavaScript, DOM, Web
          APIs, Node, npm, Git, GitHub, Bash.
          The code I work on is well tested (100% coverage and CI/CD) and
          documented in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not a designer in the sense that I can make something pretty,
          but everything I do focusses on the people that use the things I make.

          <h3><b class=project>unified</b>, Open Source Software</h3>
          <p class="range low"><time datetime=2014-6>June 2014</time> — present</p>
          <p>
            As core team member and creator of the
            <a href=https://unifiedjs.github.io>unified</a> ecosystem and the
            300+ projects under its umbrella I’m working to make it easier for
            developers to develop.
            unified is an ecosystem of text processing libraries, plugins, and
            utilities.
            Since May 2019, my work on unified has been funded by the community,
            including sponsors such as ZEIT, Gatsby, Netlify, on
            <a href=https://opencollective.com/unified>OpenCollective</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In total, including unified, I work on open source since 2013,
            mostly around content, markup, natural language, and syntax trees.
            I actively maintain about ±400 repositories and ±600 packages, that
            are collectively downloaded ±10 billion times a year.
            Outside of unified, I like to work on

            <a href=https://github.com/words/emoji-emotion>lego-brick</a>

          <p>
            I get really excited about content and syntax trees.
            We’re already seeing interesting things (such as JAMstack and MDX)
            pop up, and I can’t wait to see what the the future holds in store
            for content and syntax trees and want to work towards advancing
            that.

        <h3><b class=project>Frontend Applications</b>, <b class=project>Functional Programming</b>, and <b class=project>Frontend Data</b>, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam</h3>
        <p class="range low"><time datetime=2018-10>October 2018</time> — <time datetime=2018-11>November 2018</time></p>
        <p>
          As coordinator (and teacher) of these three advanced technical
          courses, I was responsible for the curriculum and syllabus of this new
          track, a programme on mastering frontend libraries such as D3,
          frameworks such as React and Vue, dealing with big datasets, and
          visualising data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an earlier iteration, when only the course frontend data existed,
          I built a system where students handed in code through GitHub,
          continuous integration automatically checked their submissions, and
          immediately deployed to a website when their work was up to standards.
          This allowed students to get feedback earlier and at all times.
          This worked well in “old-school” education where there is limited
          time for teachers and students to interact.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this iteration, we instead focussed on finding a place where
          students and teachers could work full-time for six weeks to learn
          together.
          We collaborated with three public sector partners (such as the public
          library of Amsterdam) to work with their data and attempting to solve
          their challenges, in return for their facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a lot of fun to work on actual problems and to learn together
          with 35 students, 10 guest speakers, 3 industry partners, and 2
          teachers, building ±100 prototypes.

          I am a qualified teacher with 4½ years experience.
          I coordinated courses, lectured, mentored one-on-one and in small
          groups, and taught about technical topics ranging from
          a student’s first prototype to complex apps.

          I studied at a design bachelor programme focused on interactive
          digital products and services.
          Half way through my studies I started focussing on how to make those
          things reality.
