      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          My open source work ranges from code concepts such as parsers and syntax trees
          to people things such as community management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am experienced in JavaScript,
          TypeScript,
          Rust,
          Node.js,
          and frontend development.
          My experience includes topics such as tooling,
          web frameworks,
          performance,
          and accessibility.
          I know a lot about the inner workings of markdown,
          HTML,
          CSS,
          JavaScript,
          DOM,
          Web APIs,
          Node,
          npm,
          Git,
          GitHub,
          Bash.
          The code I work on is high quality,
          thoroughly tested,
          and documented in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not a designer in the sense that I make pretty things,
          but everything I do focusses on the people that use the things I make.

          <h3><b class=project>unified</b>, Open Source Software</h3>
          <p class="low range"><time datetime=2014-6>June 2014</time> — present</p>
          <p>
            As core team member and original creator of the
            <a href=https://unifiedjs.github.io>unified</a> ecosystem and the
            300+ projects under its umbrella,
            I’m making it easier for developers to develop.
            <b>unified</b> is an ecosystem of text processing libraries,
            plugins,
            and utilities.
            Since 2019,
            my work on unified has been by the community,
            including sponsors such as Vercel,
            Gatsby,
            Motif,
            HashiCorp,
            GitBook,
            American Express,
            Netlify,
            and many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In total,
            including unified,
            I work on open source since 2013,
            mostly around content,
            markup,
            natural language,
            compilers,
            and syntax trees.
            I maintain about <a href="https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&q=user:wooorm+user:mdx-js+user:micromark+user:remarkjs+user:rehypejs+user:retextjs+user:unifiedjs+user:syntax-tree+user:vfile+user:get-alex+user:words">±550 GitHub repositories</a>,
            ±850 npm packages,
            that are collectively downloaded ±40 billion times a year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to monthly or one-off sponsorship companies sometimes employ
            me as a freelancer to develop.
            The most recent example is Vercel with
            <a href=https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs>markdown-rs</a>
            and
            <a href=https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs>mdxjs-rs</a>,
            which is how I thoroughly learned Rust.
            Before that was Salesforce with
            <a href=https://github.com/micromark/micromark>micromark</a>.

        <h3><b class=project>Frontend Applications</b>, <b class=project>Functional Programming</b>, and <b class=project>Frontend Data</b>, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam</h3>
        <p class="low range"><time datetime=2018-10>October 2018</time> — <time datetime=2018-11>November 2018</time></p>
        <p>
          As coordinator (and teacher) of these three advanced technical
          courses,
          I was responsible for the curriculum and syllabus of this new
          track,
          a program on mastering frontend libraries such as D3,
          frameworks such as React and Vue,
          dealing with big datasets,
          and visualising data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an earlier iteration,
          when only the course frontend data existed,
          I built a system where students handed in code through GitHub,
          continuous integration automatically checked their submissions,
          and immediately deployed to a website when their work was up to
          standards.
          This allowed students to get feedback earlier and at all times.
          This worked well in “old-school” education where there is limited
          time for teachers and students to interact.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this iteration,
          we instead focussed on finding a place where students and teachers
          could work full-time for six weeks to learn together.
          We collaborated with three public sector partners (such as the public
          library of Amsterdam) to work with their data and attempting to solve
          their challenges,
          in return for their facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a lot of fun to work on actual problems and to learn together
          with 35 students,
          10 guest speakers,
          3 industry partners,
          and 2 teachers,
          building ±100 prototypes.

          I studied at a design bachelor program focused on interactive
          digital products and services.
          Half way through my studies I started focussing on how to make those
          things into reality with code.
